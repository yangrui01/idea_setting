      <item value="Ensure that a release propagates, even if there are other in-progress acquiresreleases. This proceeds in the usual way of trying to unparkSuccessor of head if it needs signal.

Also, unlike other uses of unparkSuccessor, we need to know if CAS to reset status fails, if so rechecking." />
